# used â€“ A tribute to The Winstons and the lost music samples

__Description and thoughts:__

Since the late 1980s, sampling as a musical practice has been an important part of pop music and has become usual, so that we, as listeners, easily lose sight of what, or rather __who, we are listening to__. 

__used__ is a community sample library app that is fun to use. Discover music samples and deepen your knowledge about music by using __used__ to explore connections between tracks and artists from different decades and genres. If you know a sample that isn't yet listed, you can add it to the database using the sample pair form and share your discovery and knowledge with other __used__ users. You can also create tracks and artists. Your favorites and entries are collected on your personal profile page. __used__ inspires you to dive deep into music.

__In memory of The Winstons and Gregory C. Coleman:__

In 1969, soul and gospel band The Winstons released their song _Amen Brother_ on the B-side of a single. Almost 20 years later, the famous _Amen Break_ drum loop was created based on a six-second drum break sample, which can still be heard today in almost every drum'n'bass and jungle production as well as in numerous hip-hop breakbeats. The band's drummer Gregory C. Colemans died homeless in 2006.
